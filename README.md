To perform the tasks, I used **Python** as the programming language along with libraries like **Requests** for API integration, **Pandas** for data handling, and **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for creating the visualization dashboard. The weather data was fetched from the **OpenWeatherMap API**, processed using Pandas, and plotted as a multi-panel dashboard. The task was executed in a Python environment, but you can run it easily on platforms like **Jupyter Notebook**, **VS Code**, or **Google Colab**.From this task, I learned how to integrate a public API (OpenWeatherMap) with Python to fetch real-time data, process it using Pandas, and visualize it effectively using Matplotlib and Seaborn. It reinforced the importance of clear data parsing, proper use of timestamps, and how visualizations can help interpret trends like temperature, humidity, and wind speed over time. Additionally, I saw how a simple script can be transformed into a useful dashboard for quick insights into real-world data.
